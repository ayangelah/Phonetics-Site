                     (the last was Hagiwara 1995, which was WPP #90), and all of those are available online as part of the online version of WPP. The Linguistics Department website now provides an almost complete list of students' downloadable dissertations, as well as some 
                     <a href="https://linguistics.ucla.edu/masters-theses/" class="subtitle-2 stretched-link web-link" style="position: relative;">masters theses,</a>
                     and so we no longer list links separately here unless they are currently missing from the departmental page, or the students were in the Applied Linguistics program rather than the Linguistics Department.

          <p><i>UCLA Working Papers in Phonetics</i> (<i>WPP</i>) offers a preliminary report on work in progress in the UCLA Phonetics Lab. Through #102 in
          December 2002, it appeared as a print publication at irregular intervals at
          a frequency of one to three issues per year. <big><font style="color: black;" color="#ff6666"><small>Since Fall 2004, new issues of WPP have appeared in electronic form only.&nbsp;</small></font><small>There will be no more print issues, and<b> </b></small><font color="#ff6666">print copies are no longer available</font>.&nbsp;<small>The
          electronic-only issues are numbered continuing where the print issues stopped,
          so that the first electronic issue was #103 in 2004. The most recent issue is #111 from December 2012.
          Since Fall 2007, our entire back catalog, dating from 1964, has been
          scanned and made available online along with the newer online-only issues. For
          the original print issues, each issue is a single file, with not only
          the research papers, but the inside and outside covers and the table of
          contents included in the scans.</li><li>For
          the newer online-only
          issues, each paper is a separate file/publication. Unfortunately the
          table of contents is not organized by issues (though the papers are
          titled and paginated by issues) and lists the papers in alphabetical
          order by first author's last name within the same publication year;
          this is the format used in eScholarship and&nbsp;we&nbsp;have no
          control over this. </li></ul><br>Note that dissertations by students in the Phonetics Lab have not been
            distributed as <i>WPP </i>since 1995<i>. </i>&nbsp;Virtually all dissertations since&nbsp;the mid-eighties can be downloaded from the <a href="http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/research/55-ucla-phd-dissertations.html">Linguistics Department</a> or the <a href="http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/faciliti/research/research.html#Dissertations">Phonetics Lab</a>. The Linguistics Department continues to work on making more of the back 
           catalog of dissertations available online.<br>
