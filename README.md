UCLA phonetics lab website update project

This is the updated static site for the UCLA Phonetics Lab, currently in progress of
feature implementation, page migration, and UX/UI modifications.

New site to be hosted on humspace.ucla.edu. The current hosting is
http://phonetics.linguistics.ucla.edu/, which will become inaccessible after migration.
