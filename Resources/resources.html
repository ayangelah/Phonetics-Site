                      <h2>How to do Static Palatography</h2>
                      <p>Static palatography is a well-known traditional method of obtaining articulatory data. It is a low-tech, inexpensive tool that 
                      can be easily used in the field for phonetic description, both qualitative and quantitative. It records contact with one, sometimes 
                      two, articulatory surfaces. A <a href="#palatogram_jump">palatogram</a> is a record of contact on the palate. A <a href="#linguogram_jump">linguogram</a> is a record of contact by the tongue. 
                      Less common is the <i>dentogram</i>, <i>labiogram</i>, <i>gingogram</i>, ad lib. The basic principle is that an articulator either deposits dark material 
                      onto, or wipes it off of, the contacted surface.</p>
                      <br>
                      <p>The method presented here is what is currently used here at the UCLA Phonetics Lab. It is a much improved process developed from an earlier method that 
                        had many drawbacks. The previous way of doing palatography involved chocolate powder dusted onto the surface of the palate, creating both a palatogram and 
                        linguogram at the same time. While the present method requires that the palatogram and linguogram be created separately, it is much less messy and creates 
                        high-contrast images that photograph well. Also, the absence of chocolate powder in the current method eliminates the possibility of increased salivation 
                        which decreased the contrast of the earlier palatograms.</p>

                          <p>A palatogram is an image of the region of the upper surface of the vocal tract contacted by the tongue due to a consonant. The best way to obtain such 
                          an image is to coat the tongue with a mixture of equal parts olive oil and activated charcoal powder and record the resulting transfer of pigment.</p>

                            <li>Ask the speaker to produce a word that contains the target sound (The word should not include any other sounds that make contact with the palate).</li>

                          <p>Palatograms and linguograms should always be accompanied by diagrams showing the shape of that particular speaker's mouth in the form of a traditional 
                            sagittal section.  Diagrams of this kind can be based on dental impressions of the oral cavity made in the field.  Use chromatic dental alginate (such 
                            as Jel-Trate) as the impression material. Other substances which set harder and cannot be cut are of no use.  There is no reason for these impressions 
                            to be made using a tray of the kind that dentists use, which takes an impression of the outer surfaces of the teeth.  The outer surfaces of the teeth 
                            play no role in the production of speech, so they can be neglected.  All that is needed is an impression of the inner surfaces of the teeth and roof 
                            of the mouth.</p>

                        <p>Slice each of the resulting quadrants horizontally, 5 mm above the plane of the teeth (i.e. with the blade of the knife parallel to the surface of the impression 
                          material corresponding to the plane of the teeth).  It is then possible to measure the distance of this plane from the roof of the mouth, and to draw a line round it.</p>

                        <p>In order to assist with the scaling it is also advisable to draw round the base of the teeth.   Check with your local biology or physical anthropology departments for 
                          a tomograph with which to make the 5 mm horizontal slices.  Otherwise, it is relatively easy to make a tool to cut the alginate mold parallel to the plane of the teeth.  
                          On a flat, smooth, 190 x 125 mm wooden board paste heavy cardboard strips parallel to each other, 70 mm apart, resulting in a two “walls” of height 5mm.  On top of, 
                          and perpendicular to the cardboard walls place an 80 mm long razor blade, creating a wide slicing area.  Push each quadrant of the dental impression through this tool 
                          so as to cut off the bottom 5 mm of impression material in the occlusal plane.  Place the quadrants back together at the origin on the graph paper, trace them, and repeat
                          the process until all of the impression material is drawn in this way.</p>

                        <b>Alternatively, you can use a cast to get the contour lines: fill the cast with liquid to depths of 5, 10, and 15 mm, photographing each depth.</b>

                        <h3>Superimposing on Photographs</h3>
                        <p>To superimpose the contour lines and the marks of the teeth accurately on the photograph, it is first necessary to be certain that the photographs are not distorted. 
                          They will be foreshortened, if the mirror was not at a 45&deg; angle to the plane of the teeth.  The scaling can be done quite easily if the photograph has been entered 
                          into a computer, either by scanning it, or by conversion from the video.  The contour lines, location of the teeth and the tracing of the sagittal section can also be 
                          scanned in, and then the image of the roof of the mouth scaled independently in each direction so that obvious landmarks, such as the distance between certain teeth 
                          are adjusted appropriately. 

                        <p>For a detailed illustration of this process please refer to Ladefoged's chapter on static palatography in his 2003 book, Phonetic Data Analysis.</p>

                          <p>There are some practical points in connection with palatography that should be noted.  Firstly, care should be taken in selecting appropriate words. We are often interested 
                          in comparing the places of articulation of different sounds.  Accordingly words must be chosen that contain these articulations, and do not contain any other similar articulations 
                          that might overlap with them.  Thus when investigating the difference between s and sh in English one should use words such as "sop-shop" rather than "sot-shot."  Similarly one 
                          should use either a range of vowels ("seep-sheep, sip-ship, same-shame, Sam-sham, sop-shop, etc.") or, if this is not possible, just open vowels which might be expected to have 
                          less effect on the consonant articulation.  As with all instrumental phonetic investigations, time spent selecting suitable words is a good investment.</p>

                          <p>When doing palatography, one should allow the speaker to practice the task extensively.  It is important to get the speakers to relax after the tongue or upper surface of the 
                          mouth have been painted, so that when they say the word being investigated they do so naturally.  It also requires practice to stick the tongue out of the mouth the same way 
                          every time.  It is obviously important to date and label the photographs as soon as they are taken.  In addition, again as with all instrumental data, it is preferable to make 
                          records of several different speakers saying a few utterances rather than one or two speakers repeating a large number of different utterances.  Ideally one would like to get a 
                          dozen speakers of the same dialect each repeating a dozen times all the contrasts to be investigated.  But making palatographic records is fairly time consuming, and in a world 
                          in which time and effort are limited one may have to be satisfied with half a dozen speakers saying each word once.  We hope, however that gone are the days when phoneticians 
                          such as Ladefoged made general statements about some West African languages based on the palatographic records of a single speaker of each language. We need to find out the 
                          properties of the language that a group of speakers have in common, rather than the details of an individual's pronunciation.</p>

                        <p>The UCLA Phonetics Lab has equipment to record the airflow from the mouth and nose. In addition, it can record the pressure of the air in the front of the mouth and in the pharynx. 
                          The system is illustrated in Figure 1. It consists of a data acquisition system (small box at the bottom left of the picture) connected to a laptop or desktop computer (bottom right), 
                          and an assembly with oral and nasal masks and pressure tubes held by the speaker, together with a microphone that records the sound.At the UCLA Phonetics Lab, we have the equipment 
                          shown in Figure 1 (oral and nasal masks, analysis box, and tubing), as well as a Rothenberg mask.Any of these masks can also be used with the 4-channel CSL box, but this set-up will 
                          not be discussed here.</p>

                        <p>The mask for capturing the oral airflow fits around the mouth and below the jaw. The nasal airflow mask is fastened over the nose by a band that goes around the head. Both masks are 
                          joined to the assembly by small tubes. The masks can be used either together or independently (though the oral airflow apparatus must be present, over the mouth or not, in any set-up, 
                          since it contains the pressure transducers).</p>

                          <li>Make sure the tubes for pressure and flow are placed over the corresponding pressure and flow ports.</li>
                          <li>The nasal mask has only one tube. This should be placed over the flow port. (There is no nasal pressure to be measured.)</li>

                        <p>The data can be analyzed using the Macquirer or PCquirer software (or CSL).If the acquisition box is connected to a computer running Macquirer or PCquirer, the program will automatically

                        <h2>5. Measuring air pressure and airflow</h2>

                        <p>To quantify the differences between sentences, we can measure the airflow and pressure data using scales such as those shown on the y-axes in Figure 2.The unit for airflow is milliliters 
                          per second (ml/s), and the unit for pressure is centimeters of water (cm H2O).</p>

                        <p>Flow is measured in terms of the volume of air that passes a given point in a second (ml/s). To make sure that your data is measured in standard units (ml/s or cm H2O, rather than in the 
                        volts that the transducers actually measure), it is necessary to calibrate the equipment (especially if the equipment has been recently moved). Calibrating the rate of flow requires an 
                        apparatus like the one shown in Figure 3. A fan produces a steady stream of air that flows through the mask and then on through a special flow calibration tube.The tube contains a ball 
                        that is blown higher in the tube as the flow is increased.In the UCLA Phonetics Lab, this apparatus is part of a wooden calibration box stored with the aerodynamics equipment, as shown 
                        in Figure 3.</p>

                        <p>Pressure is measured as the force required to raise or lower the height of a column of water by a certain amount. In terms of oral air pressure, this corresponds to how much effort you 
                        would have to use to blow bubbles out of a tube immersed in water.</p>

                        <p>To ensure standard units, the system can be calibrated with the U-tube shown in Figure 4. When the tap is open, the tube can be filled with water to the zero level, with the water level 
                          reaching the same height in both branches. The figure shows what happens when the tap is closed and pressure is applied by pushing the syringe down. In this case the level has gone up by 
                          5 cm on the one side and gone down by 5 cm on the other side, so that the pressure being applied is 10 cm H2O.This apparatus is also found on the wooden calibration box in the UCLA 
                          Phonetics Lab.</p>

                        <h2>Introduction</h2>

                        <p>An electroglottograph (EGG) is a non-invasive device that indexes the contact area between the two vocal folds. A small, high-frequency current is passed between 
                          two electrodes that are secured around the neck at the level of the larynx.  The opening and closing of the vocal folds causes variation in the electrical resistance 
                          of the current.  These changes in resistance are then displayed onscreen.</p>

                        <h2>How an EGG works</h2>

                        <p>While human tissue is a fairly good conductor of electricity, air is not.  During phonation, the vocal folds (human tissue) are, at times, separated by the glottis 
                          (air). As the vocal folds move apart, the glottis opens, thereby increasing the electrical impedance across the larynx.  When the vocal folds come closer together, 
                          the size of the glottis decreases, thereby decreasing the electrical impedance across the larynx.  These changes in impedance are then displayed in a signal onscreen.</p>

                        <h2>How to use an EGG</h2>

                        <p>The lab is equipped with a two-channel electroglottograph (Model EG2, Glottal Enterprises).  The instructions given below are based on instructions prepared by <a href="https://www.glottal.com/">Glottal Enterprises</a>, 
                          but with additional steps and helpful hints.</p>

                          Here is what the front panel of the EGG looks like:
                          <figure>
                            <img src="./EGG_figures/egg_figure_1.gif">
                            <figcaption>Figure 1: Two-channel EGG</figcaption>
                          </figure>

                        <h2>Selecting the signal</h2>

                        <p>Select one of the four signals, described below, using the “Output Signal” (knob #4 in Figure 1).</p>
                        <ul class="unordered-list">
                          <li>VFCA (Vocal Fold Contact Area)</li>
                          <li>IVFCA (Inverse Vocal Fold Contact Area)
                          <i>The VFCA and IVFCA are the most common EGG signals.</i>
                          <li>DEGG (Differentiated EGG) - This output represents the differentiated EGG signal, in VFCA polarity. 
                          <li>Ext LF (Extended Low Frequency response) - This output allows you to observe the lower frequency components of the laryngeal movement. 
                        </ul>
                        <p>In addition, you can also manipulate the low frequency limit (#3).  According to Glottal Enterprises “the higher cutoff frequencies (10 Hz to 40 Hz) will allow the 
                          display to be better stabilized [but].... a slight waveform distortion...” will occur.</p>

                        <h2>Setting up the EGG</h2>
                        
                        <ol class="ordered-list">
                          <li>Insert the electrodes into the port labeled “ELECTRODES” (#2) on the EGG. Connect the EGG box to the A/D device - usually the XAudio box (connected to the computer), 
                            but sometimes in the field a laptop sound card.</li>

                          <li>Turn the EGG on by turning the battery knob (#1) to either “A” or “B”, depending on which battery is currently charged. (If you select battery “A”, then “B” is being 
                            charged, or vice versa.) The light above the battery knob should now be green.  If it is red, the battery you selected is not fully charged; in that case, just select 
                            the other battery.  Even if the unit is plugged in, you must select a battery.</li>

                          <li>Cover the gold surface of the electrodes with a thin layer of electrode gel.  A Q-tip works well for this.   (If the gel is not available, a saline solution can be 
                            used to wet the electrodes.)</li>

                          <li>Place the electrodes on the subject's neck at the level of the thyroid cartilage. (According to the directions from Glottal Enterprises, the left electrode (from 
                            the subject's point of view) is the one with the black band of wires, though we found that it does not matter.)   The white gap separating the gold-plated areas on 
                            the electrodes should be roughly horizontal, not vertical.</li>

                          <li>Make sure that the electrodes are positioned at the correct distance apart (on either side of the thyroid cartilage) for your subject.</li>

                          <li>Now that the electrodes are attached, you will need to make sure that they are in the correct positions.  While having the subject produce a constant, prolonged 
                            vowel sound, in the pitch range to be tested, adjust the vertical position of the electrodes, so that the center green light on the “Electrode Placement/Laryngeal 
                            Movement” (#5) indicator is lit. If the electrodes are not in the right place, the bar will indicate whether you should move up or down.</li>
                          <br>
                          <p><b>Note:</b> The indicator is very sensitive, and small changes in movement cause large changes on the indicator.  I found that one (slightly) easier way to center the 
                            indicator was to start at an extreme point (e.g., the base of the neck), and then SLOWLY move upwards until the center green light is lit.  I also found that 
                            positioning the electrodes was much easier to do on myself than on a subject.  Remember that changes in pitch will change the position of the larynx, so it is 
                            important to keep this factor constant.</p>

                          <li>The subject should try to produce a strong enough signal so that one of the green lights on the “Signal” indicator (#7) is lit. </li>
                      </ol>

                      <h2>Using PCQuirer for the EGG</h2>
                        <ul class="unordered-list">
                          <li>PCQuirerX, usually used to record from the EGG, has a very helpful feature - Scope Mode.  You can find this under Record/Play > Scope Mode.  Scope Mode will allow 
                            you to adjust the settings of the hardware, as well as the software settings (found under Options > Record/Play), before you actually begin the recording.  Select 
                            Scope Mode and have the subject produce a constant prolonged vowel. You should see the signal in Channel 1.  In this mode, you can manipulate the gain - either on 
                            the EGG itself (#6), or in PCQuirer under Options > Record/Play.</li>

                          <li>To record the EGG session, select Record under Record/Play (not in Scope Mode).  If possible, have your subject begin the vowel before you actually start the recording.  
                            This produces a better recording.</li>

                          <li>To make an audio recording along with the EGG recording, use a microphone linked to the EGG via the interface box.  You can change the gain in PCQuirer under 
                            Options> Record/Play.  This option can be manipulated in Scope Mode.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Note about the version of PCQuirer for use with the EGG:</h2>
                        <p>If you change any settings (such as gain, recording time, bandwidth, etc.), the EGG version of PCQuirer will save the changes you made, even after you exit the program.  
                          So, it is important to check most of the major settings before you begin recording.  For example, if the person who used the EGG last made a recording that was 1 minute long, 
                          and you make a recording without checking the settings, your recording will have to be exactly 1 minute long, since there is no way to end the recording early.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Cleaning the equipment</h2>
                        <p>When you are finished using the EGG, you should clean off the electrodes with an alcohol-wipe.</p> 
                        
                        <h2>Understanding the EGG Signal</h2>
                        <p>The EGG signal in the VFCA mode is an indicator of vocal fold contact area.  The top portion of the signal reflects closing of the vocal folds, while the bottom portion 
                          reflects opening.  The reverse is true in the IVFCA mode.</p>

                      <p>Each of the three transmitters fixed on the helmet produces an alternating magnetic field at different frequencies. The positions of the transmitters form 
                        an equilateral triangle whose sides limit the measurement plane of the Articulograph AG100. The alternating magnetic field induces an alternating current 
                        in the sensors, much like in a transformer and allows one to obtain the distances of each sensor from the three transmitters. It is then possible to calculate 
                        the XY coordinates and measure, store and display the positions of the 5 (up to 15) sensors.</p>

                            <p>The system must be turned on <b>at least two hours</b> before the actual experiment, in order 
                              to allow the coils to warm up and reach a stable temperature. Once the computer and the 
                              EMA system are on, it is necessary to start the Art program for the warm-up procedure 
                              to begin (after Art starts, you can exit the program and use the computer for other 
                              purposes). See the <a href="https://www.articulograph.de/">Carstens website</a> and the <a href="./manual.html">UCLA homemade manual</a> for details on Art.</p>

                          <div>
                            <p>Dip the sensors into Plasty-Late (modelers plastic)  to coat them. This step 
                            protects the sensors by facilitating adhesive removal after the session and 
                            also helps keep them clean. (It is also fine to dip the wire about 1-3 inches 
                            into Plasty-Late). The solution is milky when wet but transparent when dry.</p>

                          <h3>STEP 3: Attaching Silk Cloth</h3>
                          <div>
                            <p>(Optional but Recommended) Attach the sensors to small circles or squares of silk cloth 
                              right after dipping them in the plastic coating (so the cloth sticks to the sensor). (See Figure (3) below.)  
                              As can be seen in Figure (4),  the cloth expands the surface of the sensor coil that is attached to the 
                              tongue and consequently helps preventing the sensors from falling off. This step is only recommended 
                              for coils that will be attached to the tongue.

                          <div>
                            <p>It is important to leave the plastic coating to dry for <b>at least 2 hours (the longer the better - as a general 
                              rule, we leave the coating dry for one night)</b>, at which point the sensors can be calibrated in the magnetic field. 
                              Insufficient drying may cause the coating to be broken more easily, which results in the sensors' falling off.

                          <div>
                            <p>
                              The helmet which generates the field is positioned around the subject's head. Since the helmet is rather heavy, it is 
                              suspended from a pulley, in order to alleviate some of the weight.<br>
                              <img class="figure" src="./electromagnetic_articulography/michael_ema.jpeg">
                              <ul>
                                <li>We have found that by placing the sensors before putting on the helmet, the subject has some time to adjust to 
                                  having the sensors attached, and also does not have to sit so long with the heavy helmet on.</li>
                                <li>However, a drawback may be that one cannot check if the attached sensor coils are correctly detected in the 
                                  magnetic field during the attachment session.</li>
                                <li>Experienced experimenters may find it more efficient to place the sensors before putting on the helmet, especially 
                                  when the speech material to be recorded is relatively long.  In such a case, examine carefully whether sensors 
                                  responds to the system constantly as the lead at the coil base out  is gently twisted around.  This is usually done 
                                  when sensors are calibrated.</li>

                                  <li>Hold the sensor coils (Reversal Tweezers) -- Experimenter 1.</li>
                                  <li>Thoroughly dry the area to which the sensor coil is to be attached with a cotton gauze pad. (Cotton Gauze Pad) -- Experimenter 2</li>
                                  <li>(Optional) Put a dot on the spot of the tongue to which the sensor coil is to be attached. (Cosmetic Pencil) -- Experimenter 1</li>
                                  <li>Apply a drop of the internal adhesive to the surface of the silk cloth (on  the sensor coil) (Cyano-Veneer) -- Experimenter 2</li>
                                  <li>Wipe out the surface of the tongue quickly (New Cotton Gauze Pad) -- Experimenter 1</li>
                                  <li>Place the coil -- Experimenter 1   [Steps 4-6 must be done almost simultaneously]</li>
                                  <li>Release the tweezers immediately. (It is important to release the tweezers immediately after the attachment in order to prevent the tweezers tips from sticking to the coil.) -- Experimenter 1</li>
                                  <li>Dry the surface around the coil using a hair-dryer for about two minutes -- Experimenter 2. Experimenter 2 must start drying the subject's tongue (using cold air) from the moment in which the coil is attached. This procedure helps the sensor coils to stick to the surface of the tongue longer.  (For a short data collection session, this step can be omitted.)</li>
                                  <li>While the tongue is being dried, press the top of the coil with the tip of the tweezers for at least 30  seconds, starting immediately after the coil is attached (remove the tweezers periodically, to make sure that they did not stick to the coil). Of course, during this and the previous step the subject's tongue should remain in a position in which the coil is accessible/visible. -- Experimenter 1</li>
                                  <li>Stabilize the fine lead wire with a strip of medical tape on the cheek. (These wires must be led out via the corner of the mouth and across the cheek).</li>

                                  <li>While their tongue is being dried, subjects tend to drool. Thus, it is a good idea to provide them with tissues that they can use to dry the lower half of their face. Also, it is a good idea to keep a towel on the subject's lap during the whole attachment procedure, to protect the subject's clothes from glue spillings.</li>
                                  <li>The procedure described above is recommended when attaching sensors to the tongue as well as the lower gum. If sensors have to be attached to the upper gum, there is typically no need to dry the area with the hair-dryer, even if it is still a good idea to wipe the area with a cotton pad and to press the coil with the tweezers and/or a finger for about 30 seconds. We found that it is very useful if subjects are willing to hold their lips while we are attaching coils to the gum or teeth.  If sensors are attached outside the mouth, it is sufficient to attach them using the skin adhesive, and there is no need to dry the surface with the cotton pads and the dryer, nor to press the coils.</li>
                                  <li><b>Time to take for attaching sensor coils:</b> From experience, we know that attaching 5 sensors in their positions in the mouth and on the face typically takes  about <b>15 minutes</b>, 10 sensors take about <b>30 minutes</b>. Subjects may then require additional time to get used to speaking with the sensors.</li>
                                  <li><b>Time the coils will typically stay attached:</b> Sensor coils attached in the way described above can stay attached for as long as <b>three hours</b>, if the subject is not constantly speaking. In a data collection session, it is reasonable to expect carefully attached sensors to stay attached for <b>at least one hour</b>.</li>

                            <p>The co-ordinate system for the EMA data is determined by the helmet position during the data acquisition. 
                              Therefore, the x (horizontal) and y (vertical) values of sensor pellets, for example, placed on the tongue 
                              do not directly map to the tongue's horizontal and vertical movements.<br>
                              Thus, the EMA data requires rotation to the occlusal plane.<br>
                              The occlusal plane (sometimes called "bite plane") is generally determined using a bite plate on which two 
                              sensor pellets are fixed. The figure below is a bite plate we generally use here.<br>

                                information about the sensors, as well as an acoustic record of the session. (The quality 
                                of the acoustic recording is poor, so a separate audio recording is necessary if any

                              <li>Unfortunately, if acoustic data are collected, each sweep is played back as Art saves it.

                              <li>We do not use special tools to remove the pellets. Subjects typically find it easier to take off the tongue pellets by sliding their tongue under the upper teeth.</li>

                        Some subjects prefer to have the coils d. and r. attached to their teeth (approximately on the ridge between the front incisors), and this is necessary for subjects whose gums easily bleed. However, we often attach the coils to the gum, instead (under the lower front incisors; over the upper front incisors). An advantage of gum attachment is that the lips hold the coils in place. Furthermore, after coil removal, the glue tends to go away earlier from the gum than from the teeth.<br>

The cut-off frequency is at sample frequency/25.  At a sample frequency of 1000 Hz, the cut-off frequency if 40 Hz and the filter offers a 60 dB depression at 90 Hz.  (The cut-off frequency, therefore, depends on the sample frequency.) USE THIS FOR SENSORS AT TWO REFERENCE POINTS (UPPER GUMLINE, NOSE BRIDGE.)</li>
                                <li>Filter_100: The cut-off frequency is at sample frequency/10. As a sample frequency of 1000 Hz, the cut-off frequency is 100 Hz and the filter offers a 60 dB depression at 150 Hz. USE THIS FOR MOST SENSORS.</li>
                                <li>Filter_160: This filter is for weak smoothing of movement signals.  The cut-off frequency is at sample frequency/6.25. At a sample frequency of 1000 Hz, the cut-off frequency is 160 Hz and the filter offers a 60 dB depression at 210 Hz.</li>

                                <li>The dynamic correction procedure modifies the co-ordinate system individually, sample by sample, in such a way that both reference sensors stay still.  This step eliminates the errors caused by helmet movement during the recording session. (from p.9 in the Tailor manual)</li>

                                <li>First, determine carefully by what angle the data needs rotating.  This can be determined by using x'(distance between two x points) and y' (distance between two y points) values of two points on the bite plate. The angle is the arctangent of y'/x' (theta = tan-1 y'/x').</li>

                            <li>The speech processors generate, store and process the acoustic data in the compressed 4-bit ADPCM format. Emalyse can read only this compressed format.  Thus, the acoustic data in Emalyse should not be used for any serious acoustic measurement.</li>
                            <li>However, the compressed acoustic data can be 'uncompressed' to the 12-BIT PCM format which can be used for serious acoustic measures.  Multi-CV allows this conversion.  First, open a data file in the Multi-CV, mark "sound-wav" function, choose the sweep numbers you are interested in. Let it run. The 12 bit acoustic data (.wav) will be stored in the folder "Convert" in the same directory in which your original data are.</li>

                            <li>Thoroughly <b>dry the rubber coating (at least 3 hours)</b> before the experiment starts</li>
                            <li>Pay extremely careful attention to <b>drying the surface of the tongue</b> right before placing a sensor coil. Make sure that the surface is wiped twice. Drying the tongue is so important that other institutes use a "saliva vacuum" like the one dentists use.</li>
                            <li>Gently press the sensor coil against the tongue surface with the tips of the tweezers or a finger for about 30 seconds.</li>
                            <li>During the placement procedure, the second experimenter should dry the subject's tongue with a <b>hair-dryer</b>. This helps the glue drying thoroughly.  In other institutes, a tiny nozzled air blower like the ones used by dentists is used to blow air on the glued sensor coils.</li>
                            <li><b>Reversal Tweezers</b> makes the coil placement easier, preventing the sensor coils from slipping out.</li>
                            <li>It's always a good idea to have <b>two experimenters</b> performing the coil placement. One experimenter holds the coil, quickly wipes the tongue, places the sensor coil, and gently presses the sensor coil against the tongue. The second experimenter wipes the tongue before the placement procedure starts, puts a drop of glue on the silk-surfaced coil, blows the hair-dryer (with cool air).</li>
                            <li>While their tongue is being dried, subjects tend to drool. Thus, it is a good idea to provide them with tissues that they can use to dry the lower half of their face. Also, it is a good idea to keep a towel on the subject's lap during the whole attachment procedure, to protect the subject's clothes from glue spillings.</li>
                            <li>When attaching the coils to the base of incisors, make sure that <b>the front teeth do not have fillers or any synthetic material</b> that might be destroyed by the glue.</li>
                            <li>It is a good idea to design experiments so <b>they can be stopped part way through</b> and still have useful data, just in case sensors accidentally detach earlier than expected.</li>
                            <li>Dip the used sensor coils into Uni-Solve <b>at least for several hours</b> so that we can reduce the damage while peeling off the rubber coating. We typically soak them for a day or two to minimize the damage. It is also suggested (Tips and Tricks at Carstens) that the loss of receiver coils due to broken leads at the coil base can be reduced by occasionally dipping the stripped-down coils in <b>Cyano-Veneer</b> up as far as the sleeve of the coils.</li>

                        <p>Demos, and some configuration before data collection, are done in Echo Wave II, which 
                          is proprietary software provided by Telemed, the probe manufacturer. This is only 
                          installed on the data collection laptop at the moment.

                          There are two ways to collect ultrasound data. The Articulate Assistant Advanced (AAA)

                          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCENAa96efGbUDjsiGaQ9PqQ/videos">own tutorials</a>. There are 
                          numerous data processing options that are available for data collected and stored using 
                          AAA. However, the data collection process itself is very streamlined and is mainly 
                          designed with SLP clinicians in mind, so it may not work for all experimental designs.

                          The lab's Python utilities are a good deal more flexible since they are based on the 
                          <a href="https://osdoc.cogsci.nl/">OpenSesame</a> experiment GUI. OpenSesame is free and open-source, and it has the advantage 
                          of being written in Python (which is also free), which means we can easily define custom 
                          code blocks for communicating with the ultrasound device based on various triggers. A 
                          full tutorial for OpenSesame is beyond the scope of this documentation, but it has a 
                          relatively large user base and a lot of useful online discussion of common issues, as 
                          well as extensive documentation.
                          <br><br>
                          Several template OpenSesame experiments can be found <a href="https://ucla.box.com/s/zfexhunqf8627id2d7g6s6bj1zfos713">here</a>. In OpenSesame, you can 
                          customize these script templates to suit your own needs, either using the GUI or by 
                          directly editing the Python code in various sections. Unfortunately, you will only be 
                          able to <i>run</i> the script on a Windows computer which the ultrasound probes are connected to.

                            To record the ultrasound signal and align it to audio, an exchange of information 
                            between the ultrasound device, a USB audio device, and the computer needs to take 
                            place. Once you've found a suitable workstation, you'll need to set up your hardware 
                            and start the communication between the ultrasound device and the workstation.<br><br>
                            
                            For this process you will need these supplies, which are all stored in the camera case.

                              It will light up red when on.</li>
                            <li>Connect the PStretch unit (small box with black "bumpers" on either end; see picture below) to the 
                              Scarlett's 1/4" headphone jack using the 1/4" headphone to BNC cable. The BNC end of this cable must 
                              be attached to the PStretch's SYNC OUT port (this is labeled on the back of the device; on the left 
                              in the image below).<br>
                              <img class="figure" src="./ultrasound/hardware_setup_2.png">

                            <li>Attach the BNC to mini BNC cable (copper-colored and more like a wire) to the PStretch's SYNC IN port. 
                              The larger end of the cable attaches to the PStretch; you will need to twist the cable about 90 degrees 
                              clockwise to lock it in into place. The cable we use nowadays is longer than the one in the pictures here.</li>
                            <li>Attach the other end of the BNC to mini BNC cable to the Micro's "Frame Strobe" mini BNC port 
                              (pictured below). There is a small hex nut attached to the mini BNC end that you have to tighten by 
                              hand.<br>

                              below, and all connections are fully "clicked" in. <b>This is important!</b> Most problems with data 
                              collection are due to bad connections to or from the PStretch, or due to a loose connection in one of the 
                              headphone jacks. If something doesn't look right, review steps 5-7 above.</li>
                            <li>Finish making the connections to the laptop: plug the PStretch into another USB port on the computer using 
                              the black USB cable that is attached to the unit. Using the silver mini USB to USB cable, connect the Micro's 
                              mini USB port to another USB port on your computer. Note that you should use the "first" USB connection on 
                              the cable (the one which also has another USB plug coming off of it), which is pointing towards the top of the

                            <li>Finally, take your desired probe out of storage and attach it to the multi-pin socket on the front side of 
                              the Micro.</li>

                          <h4>Imaging settings</h4>
                          <p>The imaging settings are adjusted in <b>Echo Wave II</b>. We will generally load preset combinations of settings into 
                            Echo Wave II. This is ideally done before you 
                            <a href="./telemed_documentation.html">fit the stabilization headset and probe</a> 
                            to your speaker.</p><br>

                          <ol class="ordered-list">
                            <li>Run Echo Wave II with the desired probe connected. This often takes a few seconds to start up.</li>
                            <li>Check the settings. Echo Wave II automatically uses the settings that were used in the last session 
                              for that probe, whether or not they were a preset. Four presets are available, two for each of the 
                              two probes. These are available as .dat files stored on the data collection laptop, and which can also 
                              be downloaded <a href="https://ucla.box.com/s/zfexhunqf8627id2d7g6s6bj1zfos713">here</a>.

                                <li>Normal setting: records at 82 frames per second; full field of view. Good for most speech sounds and study questions.</li>
                                <li>Large probe (Telemed MC4): telemed-MC4.dat</li>

                                <li>Faster setting: about 120 frames per second; smaller field of view (60 percent of normal). Best used for flaps, taps, 
                                  and other similarly quick (sub)segments, or where especially fine temporal detail is needed for other reasons.</li>

                                <li>Depending on your needs, leave the existing preset in place or load a new preset by importing a .dat file. Click the

                          </ol>
                          <p>If needed, you can also create custom imaging settings and save them as a new .dat file. However, the presets generally work 
                            well and you will probably not need to reinvent the wheel here.</p><br>
                          <h4>Probe stabilization</h4>
                          <p>With Echo Wave II open to check the probe position, you will now want to put the stabilization helmet on your speaker, then 
                            put the probe into position in the stabilization headset. This process is explained in more detail 
                            <a href="./telemed_documentation.html">here</a>.

                            After you are satisfied with your probe placement, you must close Echo Wave II to collect data using the experiment software. 
                            Whatever settings you were using here are the ones that will be used during recording, even though Echo Wave II is not open.</p><br>
                          <h4>Software 2: the experiment script</h4>
                          <p>To start your OpenSesame session, you will need to do the following in order. Before you start you should turn off the device's wifi 
                            (which makes the connection to the ultrasound more stable), and make sure that the computer is not scheduled to restart for software 
                            updates.</p>
                          <br>
                          <ol class="ordered-list">
                            <li>Open the <b>Anaconda Prompt</b> and type in the following: <b>C:\Users\linguist\Anaconda2\Scripts\opensesame.exe</b>. This will 
                              open OpenSesame with the required permissions. Using this command in another terminal will not work.</li>
                            <li>A blank experiment loads by default. Open your experiment file of choice. We keep several template experiments in the Box folder 
                              <a href="https://ucla.box.com/s/zfexhunqf8627id2d7g6s6bj1zfos713">here</a>; these can be adapted for your needs.</li>
                            <li>Before running the experiment, open the <b>Windows PowerShell</b> and type in: <b>C:\echobserv.200.exe</b>, which starts up the 
                              communication between the ultrasound device and the collection laptop's hard drive.</li>
                            <li>At this point, run your experiment. A small MATLAB console will appear, showing a live video of the ultrasound signal. You <i>cannot</i> 
                              close this window, since it will cut off communication with the ultrasound. Since you will need to use this to monitor the 
                              <a href="./telemed_documentation.html#landmark">swallow task and bite 
                                plate task</a>, we suggest clicking on the double, small green arrow (Run in Window) instead of the large green arrow (Run Full-screen). 
                                This will open up a moveable window instead of full-screening the experiment. Once the landmark tasks are done, you should cover the 
                                MATLAB window up with the experiment window so that the participant can't see their own articulations.</li>
                          </ol>
                          <p>The experiment template contains code which displays "slides" to the participant for three types of events. You will generally want these 
                            to happen in this order:</p><br>
                          <ol class="ordered-list">
                            <li>Your experiment will probably begin with the 
                              <a href="./telemed_documentation.html#landmark">swallow task and bite plate task</a>, 
                              which we use to get more details on the recording session's physical frame of reference. These each have their own script items which can 
                              be repeated a desired number of times. Essentially, each triggers an ultrasound recording that lasts from a starting keypress to an ending 
                              keypress, allowing the participant to take as long as needed.</li>
                            <li>Slides familiarizing the participant with the study usually occur after the swallow and bite plate tasks. These advance as the participant 
                              clicks through.</li>
                            <li>Finally, most of the runtime is taken up by a loop which runs experiment blocks a specified number of times. Trials can be randomized. 
                              These are again self-paced, with the recording restarting whenever the participant clicks through to indicate they have finished reading 
                              the presented item.</li>
                          </ol>
                          <p>We suggest providing a break every 10-20 trials, between blocks. To avoid fatiguing participants, we also don't suggest trying to record more 
                            than 500-600 sentence-length trials in total. This takes about 30 minutes depending on the participant's speed, and spending much longer than 
                            that in the headset can be fatiguing.</p>

                          <p>Displaying a live feed of someone's tongue with the ultrasound device is 
                            much simpler than doing data collection. The Echo Wave II software is designed 
                            for just this task in clinical or diagnostic settings, and the probe usually 
                            doesn't need to be stabilized. If Echo Wave II is opened full-screen and projected 
                            at the front of the room or shared over Zoom, students can usually make out all the 
                            relevant details of lingual articulation.</p><br>

                            <li>Connect the ultrasound device (the small, silver box) to the laptop using the 
                              silver mini-USB to USB cable. You should use the "first" USB plug rather than the 
                              second one branching off it. See picture below.</li>

                              the other end of the ultrasound device.</li>
                            <li>Double-click the Echo Wave II 2.6.2 shortcut on the desktop and allow it to run. 
                              Start-up takes a few seconds.</li>

                            on yourself or a volunteer 
                            speaker, minus the stabilization headset (which is not usually needed for simple demos).</p><br>
                          <h4>Demo tips</h4>
                          <p>Ultrasound is useful for visualizing lingual articulation but cannot visualize much else. Since the 
                            probe will probably not be stabilized, height or degree of constriction will also be hard to eyeball. 
                            The most useful demos focus on big, visible articulations, which include:</p>
                          <ul class="unordered-list">
                            <li>Showing what various complex lingual segments look like, such as flaps, taps, /l/, /ɹ/, or other 
                              liquids that volunteer speakers might produce. Vibration of the tongue tip in the trill [r] is also 
                              often visible in the signal.</li>
                            <li>If you are demoing for Ling 103, ultrasound is great for troubleshooting students' production of 
                              clicks, as well as retroflex, palatal, uvular, and pharyngeal places of articulation. You can produce 
                              these yourself to demonstrate or get a native speaker of a language which has these contrasts 
                              (Arabic, Tamil, etc) to volunteer.</li>
                            <li>Connected speech is generally fun to watch. Try simply recording yourself while explaining what's 
                              going on at a normal speaking rate.</li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>The ultrasound will run continuously unless you hit the "freeze" button, which is in the lower left corner of the screen. Freeze the signal if you are not recording something in motion, or if you need a snapshot of a particular tongue configuration.</p>
