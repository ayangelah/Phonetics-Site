                      <h2>How to do Static Palatography</h2>
                      <p>Static palatography is a well-known traditional method of obtaining articulatory data. It is a low-tech, inexpensive tool that 
                      can be easily used in the field for phonetic description, both qualitative and quantitative. It records contact with one, sometimes 
                      two, articulatory surfaces. A <a href="#palatogram_jump">palatogram</a> is a record of contact on the palate. A <a href="#linguogram_jump">linguogram</a> is a record of contact by the tongue. 
                      Less common is the <i>dentogram</i>, <i>labiogram</i>, <i>gingogram</i>, ad lib. The basic principle is that an articulator either deposits dark material 
                      onto, or wipes it off of, the contacted surface.</p>
                      <br>
                      <p>The method presented here is what is currently used here at the UCLA Phonetics Lab. It is a much improved process developed from an earlier method that 
                        had many drawbacks. The previous way of doing palatography involved chocolate powder dusted onto the surface of the palate, creating both a palatogram and 
                        linguogram at the same time. While the present method requires that the palatogram and linguogram be created separately, it is much less messy and creates 
                        high-contrast images that photograph well. Also, the absence of chocolate powder in the current method eliminates the possibility of increased salivation 
                        which decreased the contrast of the earlier palatograms.</p>

                          <p>A palatogram is an image of the region of the upper surface of the vocal tract contacted by the tongue due to a consonant. The best way to obtain such 
                          an image is to coat the tongue with a mixture of equal parts olive oil and activated charcoal powder and record the resulting transfer of pigment.</p>

                            <li>Ask the speaker to produce a word that contains the target sound (The word should not include any other sounds that make contact with the palate).</li>

                          <p>Palatograms and linguograms should always be accompanied by diagrams showing the shape of that particular speaker's mouth in the form of a traditional 
                            sagittal section.  Diagrams of this kind can be based on dental impressions of the oral cavity made in the field.  Use chromatic dental alginate (such 
                            as Jel-Trate) as the impression material. Other substances which set harder and cannot be cut are of no use.  There is no reason for these impressions 
                            to be made using a tray of the kind that dentists use, which takes an impression of the outer surfaces of the teeth.  The outer surfaces of the teeth 
                            play no role in the production of speech, so they can be neglected.  All that is needed is an impression of the inner surfaces of the teeth and roof 
                            of the mouth.</p>

                        <p>Slice each of the resulting quadrants horizontally, 5 mm above the plane of the teeth (i.e. with the blade of the knife parallel to the surface of the impression 
                          material corresponding to the plane of the teeth).  It is then possible to measure the distance of this plane from the roof of the mouth, and to draw a line round it.</p>

                        <p>In order to assist with the scaling it is also advisable to draw round the base of the teeth.   Check with your local biology or physical anthropology departments for 
                          a tomograph with which to make the 5 mm horizontal slices.  Otherwise, it is relatively easy to make a tool to cut the alginate mold parallel to the plane of the teeth.  
                          On a flat, smooth, 190 x 125 mm wooden board paste heavy cardboard strips parallel to each other, 70 mm apart, resulting in a two “walls” of height 5mm.  On top of, 
                          and perpendicular to the cardboard walls place an 80 mm long razor blade, creating a wide slicing area.  Push each quadrant of the dental impression through this tool 
                          so as to cut off the bottom 5 mm of impression material in the occlusal plane.  Place the quadrants back together at the origin on the graph paper, trace them, and repeat
                          the process until all of the impression material is drawn in this way.</p>

                        <b>Alternatively, you can use a cast to get the contour lines: fill the cast with liquid to depths of 5, 10, and 15 mm, photographing each depth.</b>

                        <h3>Superimposing on Photographs</h3>
                        <p>To superimpose the contour lines and the marks of the teeth accurately on the photograph, it is first necessary to be certain that the photographs are not distorted. 
                          They will be foreshortened, if the mirror was not at a 45&deg; angle to the plane of the teeth.  The scaling can be done quite easily if the photograph has been entered 
                          into a computer, either by scanning it, or by conversion from the video.  The contour lines, location of the teeth and the tracing of the sagittal section can also be 
                          scanned in, and then the image of the roof of the mouth scaled independently in each direction so that obvious landmarks, such as the distance between certain teeth 
                          are adjusted appropriately. 

                        <p>For a detailed illustration of this process please refer to Ladefoged's chapter on static palatography in his 2003 book, Phonetic Data Analysis.</p>

                          <p>There are some practical points in connection with palatography that should be noted.  Firstly, care should be taken in selecting appropriate words. We are often interested 
                          in comparing the places of articulation of different sounds.  Accordingly words must be chosen that contain these articulations, and do not contain any other similar articulations 
                          that might overlap with them.  Thus when investigating the difference between s and sh in English one should use words such as "sop-shop" rather than "sot-shot."  Similarly one 
                          should use either a range of vowels ("seep-sheep, sip-ship, same-shame, Sam-sham, sop-shop, etc.") or, if this is not possible, just open vowels which might be expected to have 
                          less effect on the consonant articulation.  As with all instrumental phonetic investigations, time spent selecting suitable words is a good investment.</p>

                          <p>When doing palatography, one should allow the speaker to practice the task extensively.  It is important to get the speakers to relax after the tongue or upper surface of the 
                          mouth have been painted, so that when they say the word being investigated they do so naturally.  It also requires practice to stick the tongue out of the mouth the same way 
                          every time.  It is obviously important to date and label the photographs as soon as they are taken.  In addition, again as with all instrumental data, it is preferable to make 
                          records of several different speakers saying a few utterances rather than one or two speakers repeating a large number of different utterances.  Ideally one would like to get a 
                          dozen speakers of the same dialect each repeating a dozen times all the contrasts to be investigated.  But making palatographic records is fairly time consuming, and in a world 
                          in which time and effort are limited one may have to be satisfied with half a dozen speakers saying each word once.  We hope, however that gone are the days when phoneticians 
                          such as Ladefoged made general statements about some West African languages based on the palatographic records of a single speaker of each language. We need to find out the 
                          properties of the language that a group of speakers have in common, rather than the details of an individual's pronunciation.</p>

                        <p>The UCLA Phonetics Lab has equipment to record the airflow from the mouth and nose. In addition, it can record the pressure of the air in the front of the mouth and in the pharynx. 
                          The system is illustrated in Figure 1. It consists of a data acquisition system (small box at the bottom left of the picture) connected to a laptop or desktop computer (bottom right), 
                          and an assembly with oral and nasal masks and pressure tubes held by the speaker, together with a microphone that records the sound.At the UCLA Phonetics Lab, we have the equipment 
                          shown in Figure 1 (oral and nasal masks, analysis box, and tubing), as well as a Rothenberg mask.Any of these masks can also be used with the 4-channel CSL box, but this set-up will 
                          not be discussed here.</p>

                        <p>The mask for capturing the oral airflow fits around the mouth and below the jaw. The nasal airflow mask is fastened over the nose by a band that goes around the head. Both masks are 
                          joined to the assembly by small tubes. The masks can be used either together or independently (though the oral airflow apparatus must be present, over the mouth or not, in any set-up, 
                          since it contains the pressure transducers).</p>

                          <li>Make sure the tubes for pressure and flow are placed over the corresponding pressure and flow ports.</li>
                          <li>The nasal mask has only one tube. This should be placed over the flow port. (There is no nasal pressure to be measured.)</li>

                        <p>The data can be analyzed using the Macquirer or PCquirer software (or CSL).If the acquisition box is connected to a computer running Macquirer or PCquirer, the program will automatically

                        <h2>5. Measuring air pressure and airflow</h2>

                        <p>To quantify the differences between sentences, we can measure the airflow and pressure data using scales such as those shown on the y-axes in Figure 2.The unit for airflow is milliliters 
                          per second (ml/s), and the unit for pressure is centimeters of water (cm H2O).</p>

                        <p>Flow is measured in terms of the volume of air that passes a given point in a second (ml/s). To make sure that your data is measured in standard units (ml/s or cm H2O, rather than in the 
                        volts that the transducers actually measure), it is necessary to calibrate the equipment (especially if the equipment has been recently moved). Calibrating the rate of flow requires an 
                        apparatus like the one shown in Figure 3. A fan produces a steady stream of air that flows through the mask and then on through a special flow calibration tube.The tube contains a ball 
                        that is blown higher in the tube as the flow is increased.In the UCLA Phonetics Lab, this apparatus is part of a wooden calibration box stored with the aerodynamics equipment, as shown 
                        in Figure 3.</p>

                        <p>Pressure is measured as the force required to raise or lower the height of a column of water by a certain amount. In terms of oral air pressure, this corresponds to how much effort you 
                        would have to use to blow bubbles out of a tube immersed in water.</p>

                        <p>To ensure standard units, the system can be calibrated with the U-tube shown in Figure 4. When the tap is open, the tube can be filled with water to the zero level, with the water level 
                          reaching the same height in both branches. The figure shows what happens when the tap is closed and pressure is applied by pushing the syringe down. In this case the level has gone up by 
                          5 cm on the one side and gone down by 5 cm on the other side, so that the pressure being applied is 10 cm H2O.This apparatus is also found on the wooden calibration box in the UCLA 
                          Phonetics Lab.</p>

                        <h2>Introduction</h2>

                        <p>An electroglottograph (EGG) is a non-invasive device that indexes the contact area between the two vocal folds. A small, high-frequency current is passed between 
                          two electrodes that are secured around the neck at the level of the larynx.  The opening and closing of the vocal folds causes variation in the electrical resistance 
                          of the current.  These changes in resistance are then displayed onscreen.</p>

                        <h2>How an EGG works</h2>

                        <p>While human tissue is a fairly good conductor of electricity, air is not.  During phonation, the vocal folds (human tissue) are, at times, separated by the glottis 
                          (air). As the vocal folds move apart, the glottis opens, thereby increasing the electrical impedance across the larynx.  When the vocal folds come closer together, 
                          the size of the glottis decreases, thereby decreasing the electrical impedance across the larynx.  These changes in impedance are then displayed in a signal onscreen.</p>

                        <h2>How to use an EGG</h2>

                        <p>The lab is equipped with a two-channel electroglottograph (Model EG2, Glottal Enterprises).  The instructions given below are based on instructions prepared by <a href="https://www.glottal.com/">Glottal Enterprises</a>, 
                          but with additional steps and helpful hints.</p>

                          Here is what the front panel of the EGG looks like:
                          <figure>
                            <img src="./EGG_figures/egg_figure_1.gif">
                            <figcaption>Figure 1: Two-channel EGG</figcaption>
                          </figure>

                        <h2>Selecting the signal</h2>

                        <p>Select one of the four signals, described below, using the “Output Signal” (knob #4 in Figure 1).</p>
                        <ul class="unordered-list">
                          <li>VFCA (Vocal Fold Contact Area)</li>
                          <li>IVFCA (Inverse Vocal Fold Contact Area)
                          <i>The VFCA and IVFCA are the most common EGG signals.</i>
                          <li>DEGG (Differentiated EGG) - This output represents the differentiated EGG signal, in VFCA polarity. 
                          <li>Ext LF (Extended Low Frequency response) - This output allows you to observe the lower frequency components of the laryngeal movement. 
                        </ul>
                        <p>In addition, you can also manipulate the low frequency limit (#3).  According to Glottal Enterprises “the higher cutoff frequencies (10 Hz to 40 Hz) will allow the 
                          display to be better stabilized [but].... a slight waveform distortion...” will occur.</p>

                        <h2>Setting up the EGG</h2>
                        
                        <ol class="ordered-list">
                          <li>Insert the electrodes into the port labeled “ELECTRODES” (#2) on the EGG. Connect the EGG box to the A/D device - usually the XAudio box (connected to the computer), 
                            but sometimes in the field a laptop sound card.</li>

                          <li>Turn the EGG on by turning the battery knob (#1) to either “A” or “B”, depending on which battery is currently charged. (If you select battery “A”, then “B” is being 
                            charged, or vice versa.) The light above the battery knob should now be green.  If it is red, the battery you selected is not fully charged; in that case, just select 
                            the other battery.  Even if the unit is plugged in, you must select a battery.</li>

                          <li>Cover the gold surface of the electrodes with a thin layer of electrode gel.  A Q-tip works well for this.   (If the gel is not available, a saline solution can be 
                            used to wet the electrodes.)</li>

                          <li>Place the electrodes on the subject's neck at the level of the thyroid cartilage. (According to the directions from Glottal Enterprises, the left electrode (from 
                            the subject's point of view) is the one with the black band of wires, though we found that it does not matter.)   The white gap separating the gold-plated areas on 
                            the electrodes should be roughly horizontal, not vertical.</li>

                          <li>Make sure that the electrodes are positioned at the correct distance apart (on either side of the thyroid cartilage) for your subject.</li>

                          <li>Now that the electrodes are attached, you will need to make sure that they are in the correct positions.  While having the subject produce a constant, prolonged 
                            vowel sound, in the pitch range to be tested, adjust the vertical position of the electrodes, so that the center green light on the “Electrode Placement/Laryngeal 
                            Movement” (#5) indicator is lit. If the electrodes are not in the right place, the bar will indicate whether you should move up or down.</li>
                          <br>
                          <p><b>Note:</b> The indicator is very sensitive, and small changes in movement cause large changes on the indicator.  I found that one (slightly) easier way to center the 
                            indicator was to start at an extreme point (e.g., the base of the neck), and then SLOWLY move upwards until the center green light is lit.  I also found that 
                            positioning the electrodes was much easier to do on myself than on a subject.  Remember that changes in pitch will change the position of the larynx, so it is 
                            important to keep this factor constant.</p>

                          <li>The subject should try to produce a strong enough signal so that one of the green lights on the “Signal” indicator (#7) is lit. </li>
                      </ol>

                      <h2>Using PCQuirer for the EGG</h2>
                        <ul class="unordered-list">
                          <li>PCQuirerX, usually used to record from the EGG, has a very helpful feature - Scope Mode.  You can find this under Record/Play > Scope Mode.  Scope Mode will allow 
                            you to adjust the settings of the hardware, as well as the software settings (found under Options > Record/Play), before you actually begin the recording.  Select 
                            Scope Mode and have the subject produce a constant prolonged vowel. You should see the signal in Channel 1.  In this mode, you can manipulate the gain - either on 
                            the EGG itself (#6), or in PCQuirer under Options > Record/Play.</li>

                          <li>To record the EGG session, select Record under Record/Play (not in Scope Mode).  If possible, have your subject begin the vowel before you actually start the recording.  
                            This produces a better recording.</li>

                          <li>To make an audio recording along with the EGG recording, use a microphone linked to the EGG via the interface box.  You can change the gain in PCQuirer under 
                            Options> Record/Play.  This option can be manipulated in Scope Mode.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Note about the version of PCQuirer for use with the EGG:</h2>
                        <p>If you change any settings (such as gain, recording time, bandwidth, etc.), the EGG version of PCQuirer will save the changes you made, even after you exit the program.  
                          So, it is important to check most of the major settings before you begin recording.  For example, if the person who used the EGG last made a recording that was 1 minute long, 
                          and you make a recording without checking the settings, your recording will have to be exactly 1 minute long, since there is no way to end the recording early.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Cleaning the equipment</h2>
                        <p>When you are finished using the EGG, you should clean off the electrodes with an alcohol-wipe.</p> 
                        
                        <h2>Understanding the EGG Signal</h2>
                        <p>The EGG signal in the VFCA mode is an indicator of vocal fold contact area.  The top portion of the signal reflects closing of the vocal folds, while the bottom portion 
                          reflects opening.  The reverse is true in the IVFCA mode.</p>
