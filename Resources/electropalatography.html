  <p>The Phonetics Lab acquired its Kay Palatometer Model
  6300 in 1992, with a dissertation improvement grant to Dani Byrd, and
  much use was made of it. While it is still in the lab, it has not been
  used in years: a DOS program limited to a low sampling
  rate (12.8 kHz for the audio, 100 Hz for the EPG), it requires an older
  type
  of PC with two full-size slots for the Palatometer and CSL boards.

  <h1> <a name="I. Basic Experimental Steps to"></a>I. Basic Experimental Steps
   to Follow</h1><blockquote><p><b>1. Get used to pseudo-palate.</b>
     <br>
     We usually have our speaker wear his or her pseudo-palate
   to get used to it; the more the better, but usually for an hour of normal
   activity to accommodate and diminish any salivation response (Byrd et al.
   1995).</p>
   </blockquote>
      
  <blockquote><b>2. Do the experiment.</b>
     
    <ul>
    <li> For recording, we need two pieces of hardware, CSL 
  (for audio) and the Palatometer, at the same time, which is the normal setup 
  on Jasmine now in the Physiology Lab (2101E).</li>
     <li> Detailed procedures of data collection:</li>
          
      <ol>
    <li> Have your subject wear his/her pseudo-palate.</li>
     <li> Turn off the Palatometer, attach a grounding electrode 
  to the speaker (which can be found in 2101P, the 'cool' room), connect the
   pseudo-palate to the Palatometer, and turn on the Palatometer.</li>
     <li> When ready to collect the data, run "pal.exe" (by 
  typing "pal" - you don't have to be in the directory where the program is, 
  which is also "pal"), and do three steps under the 'setup' menu on the screen:</li>
            
        <ol>
    <br>
           (1) choose the number of users <br>
           (2) choose a user name (a user file such as PKEATNG1.USR,
   THCHO.USR) for each user (back-ups of these files are on a disk kept near
   the computer, and Pat and Henry both have copies); <br>
           (3) check the sensitivity, by turning the small
  knob  while subject talks until the peak value is in the preferred range. 
        
        </ol>
         
      </ol>
          
      <p><br>
        3. Note about choosing a channel.
       </p>
       
      <blockquote>There are two channels to which two pseudo-palates
   can be connected at the same time. (This normally allows the clinician to 
  demonstrate a particular articulatory action for the client to imitate.)
   The default setting is to use Channel 1 when there is only one speaker (which 
  is our normal case), but it is possible that some older pseudo-palates may 
  work better with the Channel 2 connetion pins. If you want to use Channel
   2, you have to go to the 'setup' menu and choose it, using the 2 users/large
   views.</blockquote>
          
      <p><br>
        4. Record prepared speech materials
       </p>
       
      <ol>
        Caution: Since the "pal"
   program runs under DOS, it can capture data for only about 3 seconds.
   So, researchers should design their speech corpus accordingly.  
    
      </ol>
     5. Two options for the audio signal.
       
      <ol>
           
        <ol>
    <li> One is to use a close-talking head-mounted mike in 
  the Physiology Lab (not kept there, but ask Henry). With this set-up you can
  run an experiment at any time without special preparation or extra help. It
  should be remembered that this room is not sound-treated in any way. 
  Thus, it is recommended to use a close-talking head-mounted mike.</li>
     <li> The other option is to have the speaker in the sound 
  booth. This gives the best sound, but you must arrange it in advance with 
  Henry, since all the equipment needs to be moved to the general lab. The Palatometer
  also must go into the booth, and the booth microphone must be connected to
  Jasmine's CSL. Also, it may require an additional experimenter:
  one person to operate the program on Jasmine, and one person who can see
  and signal to the subject in the sound booth.</li>
           
        </ol>
         
      </ol>
       
    </ul>
    </blockquote>
      
  <blockquote><b>3. Analyze the data.</b>
     <br>
     The Palatometer manual contains plenty of information
  on displaying data frames, etc., and on its interactive version of the region 
  definition/percent analysis routine. But the DOS version of this routine, 
  developed here, is what we mostly use, because it allows batch processing
   and ASCII, as well as binary, output. Experienced people include: Pat K.,
   Taehong C., Sahyang K.. For a description of indices defined on percent-contact
   data, see Byrd, Flemming, Mueller &amp; Tan (1995), Using regions and indices
   in EPG data reduction, J. Sp. Hear. Res. 38, 821-827.

   by Dani Byrd, calculates contact profiles for user-defined regions of the
   palate. On Jasmine, it is in the pal\output\ directory <br>

  <ul>
     <b>2. Create a .DEF file</b>
     
    <ul>
       First, Define regions as needed. The figure below, for
   example, shows three regions defined: Front Region, Back region, and the
  entire region (Front + Back). Note that you can define as many regions (up
  to 10) as needed, using different and/or overlapping areas of the palate.
       <br>
    <li> There are 96 electrodes and each electrode is 
  assigned its unique number from 1 to 96</li>
          
      <ul>
         - <a href="./electropalatography/EPG_default.gif">default layout of numbered
   electrodes</a> (for English, Zulu) <br>
         - <a href="./electropalatography/EPG_default.gif">special layout of numbered
   electrodes</a> (for Korean, French, Taiwanese)     
      </ul>
     <li> Assign electrodes regions.</li>
     <br>
        - For example,
   if you want to examine the contact for the coronal [t] in [to] context but 
  want to exclude the contact caused by the coarticulation with the following
   [o], you first make control tokens with the [o] articulation (e.g., with
  [po]) and subtract the [o] contact from the [t] contact in the [to] context.
  This allows you to define a region just for [t] exclusively. This kind
  of process is usually done by marking contacted electrodes in the printout
  of the layout of numbered electrodes which is downloadable (<a href="./electropalatography/EPG_default.gif">default layout</a>, <a href="./electropalatography/EPG_special.gif">special layout</a>). <br>
    <li> Using a text editor, make a DEF file.

     <b>(4) Do Batch Processing</b> </p>

    <li> Cheng Cheng Saw Tan developed a method of displaying 
  Palatometer data in 3-D, on a wire model palate. These displays are the source 
  of the "Flying Palate" used as a screensaver on some of the Macs in the lab.
   Her procedures are fully documented in WPP #85 (1993). Pat has all of her
   QuickTime files, and a video of one of them is in the video cabinet in the 
  lab.</li>

  <blockquote>Keating et al (1998, LabPhon 6) and many other
   studies supported by NSF grant #SBR 9511118 (to P. Keating) showed, in their 
  EPG studies of English, French, Korean, and Taiwanese, that consonants have 
  greater linguopalatal contact in a domain-initial position than in a domain-medial 
  position and that this effect is in general cumulative: the linguopalatal 
  contact becomes greater as the domain is higher in the prosodic hierarchy. 
  Such cumulative effect was more pervasive in one language (e.g., Korean) than
  in another (e.g., English). Here, we put some results from French and
  Korean with representative EPG contact figures and sounds (.WAV format).</blockquote>
