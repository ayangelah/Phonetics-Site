 </p><p><a name="1. The Principle of Operation of the"></a><b>1.
 The Principle of Operation of the Articulograph AG100</b>
 </p><p>The Articulograph AG100 is a device
 utilizing alternating electromagnetic fields to track articulator movements
 over time during speech production. A high quality microphone is used to
 record the acoustic signal simultaneously with the articulatory data.
 <br> The system transduces
 movements of the articulators using an inductive measurement principle
 based on the physical law that the electromagnetic field strength in a
 receiver is inversely proportional to the cube of its distance from a transmitter.
 The system employs three transmitter coils placed equidistant from one
 another so that they generate a radially symmetric alternating electromagnetic
 field at different frequencies. A number of receiver coils (sensors) are
 placed on the subject's articulators (tongue, jaw, lips and teeth) along
 the midsagittal plane. The induced voltages on these receiver coils are
 sampled at a relatively high frequency. These voltages provide a measure
 of each receiver's distance from each transmitter as well as their tilt
 relative to the transmitter axes. The Cartesian coordinates of each receiver
 can be calculated as the point where the radii of three circles from the
 three transmitters intersect.
 <br> An accurate measurement
 of the distances of the sensors from the transmitters can only be achieved
 when the sensors are located in the midsagittal plane and their axes are
 aligned with the axes of the transmitter coils. If a sensor is rotated
 away from a parallel orientation, then the induced voltage declines proportional
 to the cosine of the angle of rotation (the "tilt angle") resulting in
 over-estimation of the distances. This measurement error can be estimated
 in the Articulograph AG100 system because of the arrangement of the three
 transmitter coils in an equilateral triangle: the distances to all three
 transmitter coils are expected to be distorted by the same factor. Its
 magnitude can thus be estimated by iteratively adjusting the radii in step
 until they intersect at a point.
 <br> If the sensor
 is in proper parallel alignment but outside the midsagittal plane, then
 the distance will also be distorted. This measurement error can only be
 completely corrected if the sensor is located at the dead center of the
 measurement area. If the sensor is neither in parallel alignment nor in
 the midsagittal plane, then the position cannot be determined precisely.
 </p><p><a name="2. The Helmet and Measurement Area in the"></a><b>2.
 The Helmet and Measurement Area in the Coordinate System</b>
 </p><p>The three transmitter coils are mounted
 equidistant from one another on a rigid helmet. They are labeled and color-coded
 as follows: <u>chin</u> = K (German Kinn), blue; <u>forehead</u> = S (German
 Stern), green; <u>neck</u> = N (German Nacke), red. Their arrangement is
 shown schematically in Figure 1. The distance between any pair of transmitters
 is 320.9 mm. The chin coil is taken as the origin of the coordinate system,
 and the line from the Chin to the Forehead coil is the Y axis. In an ideal
 positioning of the helmet, the Forehead coil will be positioned directly
 above the Chin coil.
 <br> The measurement
 area is shown by the circle drawn inside the triangle in the figure. The
 center of the measurement area is the point equidistant from each of the
 three transmitters. This point lies at the intersection of the three circles
 with radius <i>R</i> centered on the three transmitters, as shown in Figure
 1. Since <i>R</i> is a known distance, the response of a sensor placed
 in the center of the measurement area can be calibrated against this known
 distance. (Note the Neck transmitter is at 277.9 mm on the X axis from
 the origin and 160.45 mm on the Y axis; <i>R</i> is 185.27 mm.)

 Hardware and Software Components the Articulograph AG100</b>
 </p><p><b>(1) Hardware</b>
 <br> The principal
 hardware components of the Articulograph are (usually) kept out in public
 in Campbell 2101E. These consist of:
 </p><p>• The
 helmet and calibration stand
 <br>• The
 helmet suspension unit
 <br>• The
 analog unit which controls the transmitter coils and converts the receiver
 signals into computer input. Our unit functions with up to ten receiver
 signals
 <br>• The
 audio box that records the acoustic signals and its two small speakers
 <br>•
 The two small white preamplifier boxes to which the sensors will be connected.
 Signals pass from the preamplifier boxes into the analog unit
 <br>•
 The computer Igor, in which two special-function cards are installed, an
 IEEE-488-Bus Interface Board for the Articulograph signals, and the Artus
 962-2 Channel Acoustic Board that is responsible for the acoustic signal
 processing.
 </p><p>The hardware components are
 shown schematically in Figure 2.

 EMA data)
 </p><p><b>(2) Software</b>
 <br>On Igor there is a subdirectory
 called "AG100" on the C: drive and all the Articulograph-related software
 on this machine is installed in this directory. The
 programs you will be using for your investigation are most likely the following
 two:
 </p><p>•<u>The
 ART program</u> — a DOS program for calibrating the Articulograph, and
 carrying out the recording of articulator movement and acoustic signals.
 The execution program is under the directory c:\AG100\art730, but you can
 start the program from any directory by typing "art" (a more recent version
 of the program can be started by typing art8 from the directory c\AG100\art98).
 The Articulograph manufacturers recommend quitting Windows before running
 ART.
 </p><p>•<u>The
 EMALYSE program</u> — a Windows program analyzes and evaluates the movement
 and acoustic data you acquired in the investigation. EMALYSE runs under
 Windows. In order to run this program, you need to open Windows and double
 click on the "emalyse" icon under "Microsoft Tools".
 </p><p>Other software programs that come
 with the machine include:
 <br>•
 The A2P program that enables the recording, reproduction and revision of
 acoustic data. This is an MS-DOS program. The execution program is under
 the directory c:\articulo\a2p\eng. You can start the program from any directory
 by typing "a2p".
 <br>•
 The MULTICV program that allows you to create a copy of the Articulograph
 AG100 data in different formats or to rotate the movement curves. The execution
 program is under the directory c:\articulo\multicv. But you can start the
 program from any directory by typing "multicv". MULTICV is useful if you
 do not plan to use EMALYSE to analyze your data, and you want to export
 them in ASCII format..
 <br>•
 The POINTS program for measuring the accuracy of the Articulograph AG100.
 The execution program is under the directory c:\articulo\points. But you
 can start the program from any directory by typing "points".
 </p><p>There are manuals for all these programs.
 If you cannot find answers to your questions about these programs in this
 homemade manual, you are referred to those manuals. They are also in the
 cupboard outside the "Postdoc Office". A
 further program for analysis of Articulograph data is TAILOR. This is a
 Windows-95.

 Powering up and Starting ART</b>
 <br>Normally the helmet coils will be connected to the Analog unit; check
 that this is so. If not you will need to connect the helmet to the analog
 unit as shown in Fig. 2. Then turn on the analog unit using the switch
 at the back just above the power cord. In order for the equipment to reach
 the optimal operating temperature it is necessary to <u>activate the system
 set-up menu in the program ART after turning on the analog unit</u>. To
 activate the system set-up menu, run program ART by typing "art" under
 any directory and then select the first item in the main menu which says
 "Adj. of transmitter signal strength - signal voltages are shown". Hit
 return.
 </p><p>The program call is necessary since the current system parameters are
 stored on the hard disk of the computer and after powering up the equipment
 they must be transferred from the computer to the analog unit. This data
 transfer takes place as soon as the system set-up menu in the program ART
 has been activated. To return to the main menu hit Esc. Move cursor down
 to last item, "End of program," and hit return to exit.
 </p><p>The operating temperature, which is on the order of 50°C is reached
 within 2 hours. It is NOT necessary for the program ART to be running during
 this waiting period. The computer can be turned off or used for other purposes.
 The current parameters remain in force until the analog unit is turned
 off.
 </p><p><u>Reliable data can only be collected after the system reaches its
 stable temperature</u>. If you are performing an experiment early in the
 morning, one possibility is to to leave the analog unit on overnight, so
 the system will be ready for operation immediately in the morning.
 </p><p><a name="2. Preparing and attaching the sensors"></a><b>2. Preparing
 and attaching the sensors</b> (<a href="http://www.humnet.ucla.edu/humnet/linguistics/faciliti/facilities/physiology/ema.html">Please
 go to EMA page for updated information</a>).
 <br>The sensors are in the cupboard. Select five to use. It is very important
 to know which sensor corresponds to which preamplifier channel when you
 carry out calibration or an investigation. Carefully connect the five sensors
 to the sockets in the preamplifier box..
 </p><p>Before carrying out a measurement, it is recommended that the sensors
 are dipped in rubber solution. This reduces wear and tear on the sensors
 since the glue is not directly placed on them, and it also helps to keep
 the process hygienic. We have a supply of Plasty-late available (from hobby-time
 Bastel-System GmbH, D-88099 Neukirch/Bodensee, Germany). Allow a drying
 time of about 15 minutes. The solution is milky when wet but transparent
 when dry. After use, the fine rubber film (together with any remnants of
 the tissue adhesive used to attach the sensors to the subject) should be
 removed from the sensors before storing them.
 </p><p><a name="3. Calibration procedure"></a><b>3. Calibration procedure</b>
 </p><p> It is essential to perform a calibration of the system
 before each experiment. With the helmet on the calibration stand, pull
 the calibration magazine forwards so that the slots in it can be seen.
 After connecting the sensors to the preamplifier, load them into the calibration
 magazine in order with #1 at the back, then #2 and so on. Pass the leads
 through the central hole and out the front. Ensure that the leads are not
 close to any of the transmitters.
 </p><p> Moving the calibration magazine forwards and backwards
 allows any given sensor to be positioned in the exact center of the measurement
 area. Each one must be moved in turn to this position, and a calibration
 performed. With the ART program running, select the first item in the main
 menu by hitting return. You will see 2 columns of values for each transmitter
 in five rows, one for each sensor. If any position is returning values
 of 0 across the row, its polarity is reversed. Take it out and turn the
 plug the other way up.
 </p><p> Position sensor #1 in the center of the measurement
 area, then hit F1. The computer will then estimate the correct constant
 required to correlate the signal strength with the known distance <i>R</i>.
 Hit any key to resume. Then position sensor #2 in the center and hit F2,
 etc. with the remaining sensors. After this procedure is completed all
 sensors should be returning values about in the range 200-600. If a sensor
 returns very low values (close to 0), it could be the case that the sensor
 was attached to the preamplifier with reversed polarity. Reattach the sensor
 to the preamplifier turning its plug upside-down and try recalibrating
 the sensor.
 </p><p> After you are done calibrating the first five sensors
 (1-5), hit Tab and repeat the procedure for the second set of five sensors
 (6-10) (place sensor 6 in the magazine as if it were sensor 1, sensor 7
 as if it were sensor 2, etc.)
 </p><p> His Esc to go to the next step. A warning to recalculate
 the radius table will appear. In the main menu, go down to "Adjustment
 of geometric and parameters" and hit return. Move the cursor down to "Recalulate
 radius table". Hit return.
 <br> In this menu you can also adjust the sample rate.
 Most other items here you will never need to adjust. Hit Esc to return
 to main menu.
 <br>
 </p><p><a name="4. Preparing the Computer"></a><b>4. Preparing the Computer
 Storage</b>
 </p><p><b><u>Make sure there is enough free storage space on the hard disk.</u></b>
 The storage requirements depend not only on the recording time but also
 on the chosen measurement frequency. Additional storage capacity is also
 required for acoustic data. By way of example, an investigation consisting
 of 10 sweeps, each of 10 second, and also including acoustic data requires
 approximately 950Kbytes and without acoustic data 230 Kbytes of storage
 space, assuming a measurement frequency of 100Hz. For a measurement frequency
 of 500Hz the same investigation requires 1900 Kbytes with and 1200Kbytes
 without acoustic data.
 </p><p><a name="5. Adjustments in the System Set-up Menu"></a><b>5. Adjustments
 in the System Set-up Menu</b>
 </p><p>The system set-up menu is the menu that says "_Adj. of transmitter signal
 strength - signal voltages are shown_". Activate this menu and check that
 all channels are showing plausible values. <u>Be
 careful at this stage NOT TO ALTER THE TRANSMITTER POWER</u>. If
 you do alter a value by mistake then type the "home" key to restore the
 old values. This menu allows you in particular to specify the measurement
 frequency and the filter.
 </p><p><b>(1) Specifying the Measurement Frequency: F10</b>
 </p><p>You will be able to change the measurement frequency by pressing F10.
 This specification should be a number between 8 and 250. This number determines
 the time between 2 consecutive position measurements in units of 0.1ms.
 Accordingly, 250 means that a position measurement is carried out every
 25ms. This corresponds to a measurement frequency of 40Hz. Higher measurement
 frequencies reproduce fast movements more faithfully but require correspondingly
 more storage space. Even if ART allows you to set higher frequencies, the
 highest frequency that will actually be implemented by the system is 500Hz.
 </p><p><b>(2) Setting the Filter: F</b>
 </p><p>For technical reasons the displayed digital values fluctuate slightly.
 In order to obtain a more stable display a filter function with steps of
 2, 3 and 4 can be turned on. When the step is equal to 1 the filter is
 turned off. The current filter step is shown in the bottom line of the
 window. <u>Every time the "F" key is pressed the
 filter step is changed (1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2...)</u>. The filter is
 only useful during the set-up procedure since the displayed values will
 fluctuate less. But <u>during actual data recording,
 the filter should always be set to 1</u>.
 <br>
 </p><p><a name="6. Adjusting Values of the System Parameters"></a><b>6. Adjusting
 Values of the System Parameters</b>
 </p><p><b>Very important. Please read.</b>
 </p><p>By choosing the menu option "Show presently used parameters" you can
 examine the current settings. Should you wish to make changes, use the
 menu option "Adjustment of geometric and parameters". The "Adjustment of
 geometric and parameters" window includes the following choices:
 </p><center>Sampling rate

 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 </p><p>There are two kinds of parameters involved in this menu: parameters
 related to position calculations and program parameters. <u>YOU
 SHOULD NOT CHANGE ANY PARAMETERS RELATED TO POSITION CALCULATIONS. If you
 do so, then you have to recalculate the radius table (the program will
 prompt you to do so when you exit this menu) and recalibrate the system,
 or you can change the parameters back to their original values.</u>
 </p><p><b>(1) Parameters for Position Calculation</b>
 </p><p><b>(a) Type in the Offset Values</b>
 <br>An offset is an undesired signal present at the output of the amplifier
 when no signal is present at the input. These offset values were measured
 in the calibration process and can automatically be subtracted from the
 measured signals. Hence you should not use this function in normal operation.
 </p><p><b>(b) Type in the R-min Values</b>
 <br>The R-min table shows the values determined during calibration of the
 sensors. These values correspond in the formula
 </p><center><b>U=U0* 1/R3</b></center>
 
 <p>to the distance R at which U equals to the maximum signal voltage. The
 R-min values accordingly show the smallest possible distance between a
 sensor and a transmitter coil that can be used for position calculation.
 Since these values are acquired during calibration, they should not be
 changed in normal operation.
 </p><p><b>(c) Maximum Transmitter-Receiver Distance</b>
 </p><p>The calculation of the sensor position involves estimating the distance
 between sensor and transmitter on the basis of the signal induced in the
 sensor. However, as the measured signal approaches 0 the estimated distance
 approaches infinity. In order to avoid calculations with excessively large
 numbers all calculated distances that are larger than the parameter value
 for maximum transmitter-receiver distance are truncated to this value.
 The value is displayed in units of 0.01m and is set to 32,090.00. It should
 not be changed in your investigation.
 </p><p><b>(d) Helmet Size</b>
 </p><p>The helmet that we have is the small-size one. You should not change
 the helmet size to anything else.
 </p><p><b>(e) Power of the Radius Function</b>
 </p><p>Calculation of the sensor positions is performed on the basis that the
 measured signal is inversely proportional to the cube of the distance.

 </p><p>Yes, you can also change the measurement frequency in this menu.
 </p><p><b>(b) Number of channels</b>
 </p><p>You can specify a number between 1 and 10. This value determines the
 number of channels that are recorded and displayed during measurement.
 A value of 10 means that all 10 channels are turned on. A value of 3 activates
 channels 1, 2 and 3.

 </p><p><a name="1. Attaching the Sensors"></a><b>1.
 Attaching the Sensors</b>
 </p><p>It is a requirement of the measurement
 principle that the sensors should be positioned precisely in the midsagittal
 plane and the main axis of the transmitter coil should be as nearly as
 possible parallel to the axes of the transmitter coils.
 <br>
 </p><p><b>(1) Gluing a Sensor to the Oral
 Mucosa</b>
 </p><p>Thoroughly dry the area on the mucosa
 to which the sensor is to be attached. Apply tissue adhesive to the mucosa
 and the sensor. Then fix the sensor in place using a pair of tweezers.
 </p><p><b>(2) Gluing a Sensor to a Tooth</b>
 </p><p>Caution! The tissue adhesive damages
 plastic fillings.
 </p><p><b>(3) Gluing a Sensor to the Skin</b>
 </p><p>A sensor can be simply fastened with
 a strip of adhesive tape on normal skin.
 </p><p><b>(4) Arranging the Lead Wires</b>
 </p><p>The lead wires to the sensors must
 be sufficiently long so that they won't come down under tension during
 the articulator movements. The wires should be led out via the corner of
 the mouth and across the right cheek. Here the wires can be easily stabilized
 with a strip of adhesive tape. From the cheek the wires should be led to
 the right shoulder. Electromagnetic disturbances to the measurement signals
 can be best suppressed if the sensor lead wires are positioned as far as
 possible away from the chin and the neck transmitter coils .
 </p><p><b>(5) Allowing the Subject Time
 to Get Used to the Sensors</b>
 </p><p>Allow the subject to speak before
 placing the helmet on the subject's head. This allows the subject to get
 used to the sensors and you can determine if all the sensors are properly
 fixed in place.
 <br>
 <br>
 </p><p><a name="2. Positioning the Helmet"></a><b>2.
 Positioning the Helmet</b>
 </p><p>(<b>1) Affixing the Headband</b>
 </p><p>This plastic band is worn by the
 subject like a headband and it is fastened at the back of the head. It
 must be so positioned that the helmet's fastening screws rest on the headband.
 </p><p><b>(2) Positioning the Helmet</b>
 </p><p>Fig. 3 (to be provided soon)
 </p><p>Before putting on the helmet make
 sure the fastening screws are fully retracted. The investigator should
 then take up a position behind the subject's head and position the helmet
 on the subject's head as shown in Fig. 4. The helmet should be held in
 such a way that the red neck transmitter coil is at the bottom and the
 blue chin coil is at the top. Hold the helmet in this position and bring
 it up to the head of the subject until the red coil is close to the nape
 of the neck. the helmet must then be rotated about the red coil so that
 the blue coil moves in a circular path in front of the face. Pay attention
 to the position of the lead wires to the helmet and the lead wires from
 the sensors to the input amplifiers.
 </p><p> The fastening
 screws are then screwed into the helmet until the helmet is fixed to the
 head and the measurement area is optimally positioned.
 </p><p> The screen display
 can be used to monitor how well the sensors are located in the center of
 the measurement area. Since it is the helmet that defines the coordinate
 system for the measurements, you can adjust the position of the sensors
 in the coordinate system by repositioning the helmet.
 </p><p><b>(3) Checking the Alignment</b>
 </p><p> Hook the alignment
 device onto the forehead and chin coils and view the sensors with one eye
 by sighting along the edge of the Plexiglas. This edge defines the midsagittal
 plane. The sensors must be located on this plane. With the subject's mouth
 open, the alignment of the sensors inside the mouth can be checked. If
 necessary shift or rotate the helmet until all the sensors are in line
 with the Plexiglas edge.
 </p><p><b>(4) Checking the Tilt Factor</b>
 </p><p> Examine the size
 of the crosses with which the sensor positions are displayed on the screen.
 Small crosses indicate that the sensors are well positioned. If the screen
 shows very large crosses in the center then the polarity of the corresponding
 sensors is reversed. Check with the set-up menu (the menu that says "_Adj.
 of transmitter signal strength - signal voltages are shown_") whether these
 channels all show values of zero. If this is the case, unplug the sensors
 and plug them back in again after rotating the plug by 180?. Usually you
 don't have to worry about this because the polarity of the sensors is marked
 by tapes on their plugs.
 </p><p> If the position
 of the helmet appears acceptable and an individual sensor nonetheless shows
 a large cross, then this sensor should be removed and glued back on again.
 <br>
 <br>
 </p><p><a name="3. Performing an Actual Measurement"></a><b>3.
 Performing an Actual Measurement Sweep</b>
 </p><p>If you are making acoustic recording
 as well, don't forget to turn on the audio box and plug the microphone
 into the LEFT input port on the audio box. Also make sure the "Save acoustic
 data" item in the main menu is turned on. Now you are all in business to
 do the actual data recording. Here we go:
 </p><p><b>(1) Selecting "Measurement, Display
 and Storage of Positions" in the Main Menu</b>
 </p><p>This is the window in which you carry
 out the recording. The sensors are shown as colored small crosses, and
 a portion of an equilateral triangle whose corners correspond to the centers
 of the transmitter coils are shown on the screen too.
 </p><p> The portion of
 the measurement area displayed on the screen can be magnified in steps
 of 2, 3 and 4. <u>You can use the "Z" key to magnify the display.</u> The
 magnification factor is displayed in the status line (top line of the screen).
 </p><p> The coordinates
 of the position of the left corner of the screen display are indicated
 by the "offset" values in the status line. <u>You can modify the coordinates
 of the left corner position of the screen by pressing the "B" key</u>.
 Instructions then appear telling you how to use the cursor keys to move
 the display to the right, left, up or down.
 </p><p><b>(2)</b> <b>Turning on the Memory
 Function</b>
 </p><p><u>Use the right-arrow cursor key
 or the "M" key to turn on the memory function.</u> The word "memory" then
 appears in the status line. From now on the measurement data can be stored.
 </p><p> If a beep is heard
 and the message "no data files are open" shows on the screen, you must
 select the "Data record and commentary" in the main menu to specify the
 protocol data of the investigation.
 </p><p><b>(3) "Pen Down" Records the Data</b>
 </p><p>When the program function "measurement..."
 is running, the current sensor positions are continuously displayed on
 the screen as crosses but are not yet stored (even after the memory function
 is turned on). This is referred to as the "pen up" state. As with a plotter,
 no line is drawn as the pen is moved. The word "up" is to be seen in the
 status line at the top of the screen.
 </p><p><u>By pressing
 the down-arrow cursor you turn on the "pen down" function.</u>
 Again as a plotter, when the pen is down in touch with the paper, the movement
 trajectory is recorded, after the "pen down" function is activated, the
 movement trajectories of the sensors will be drawn on the screen and recorded
 to <u>the main memory (not hard disk)</u> of
 the computer. The acoustic data will also be recorded if you choose to
 do so.
 </p><p><b>(4) "Pen Up" Turns the Recording
 off</b>
 </p><p><u>By pressing
 the up-arrow cursor you terminate the recording.</u> The sensors
 positions are again displayed as crosses on the screen, but the recorded
 movement trajectories remain visible on the screen. At the same time the
 recorded acoustic data will be replayed and crosses indicating the magnitude
 of the tilt factor will be overlaid on the movement traces. By means of
 the acoustic recorded and the graphic display you can decide whether the
 sweep you just recorded contains the desired data.
 </p><p><b>(5) Using the "W" Key to Store
 the Desired Data on the Hard Disk</b>
 </p><p><u>If the recorded
 sweep contains the desired results, press the "W" key to store the data
 on the hard disk.</u>
 This is very important. You will lose the desired data when the next sweep
 is recorded if this step is not carried out, although you think the data
 are "recorded"--they are only "recorded" to the main memory, not your data
 files on the hard disk.
 </p><p>During the storage procedure the
 acoustic data are once again replayed. Please wait until a beep is heard,
 indicating the data have been successfully stored on the hard disk. The
 following prompt is then displayed:
 </p><p>-Commentary &lt;Return&gt;
 </p><p>and you can enter one line of commentary
 for this sweep (This prompt is only displayed if you chose the "add comments
 to the data" option in the Data Record and Commentary menu -- we typically
 do not select this option, in order to save time).
 </p><p><b>(6) Using the "C" Key to Discard
 the Undesired Data</b>
 </p><p><u>If the recorded
 sweep does not contain the desired results, press the "C" key to discard
 the recorded data and delete the movement traces on the screen.</u> You
 can repeat the recording by means of a further "pen down"--"pen up" sequence.
 </p><p><a name="4. Using the G Key to Determine a Reference"></a><b>4.
 Using the "G" Key to Determine a Reference Contour</b>
 </p><p>It is possible to use the movement
 data from one of the sensors from the last sweep as a reference contour.
 <u>By
 pressing the "G" key three options will appear on the screen: Record, Delete
 and Escape. Press "A" to record, "L" to delete a contour and Esc to terminate
 this menu.</u> After typing the "A" key, you must specify the channel
 number whose trajectory is to be used as the reference contour. This contour
 remains on the screen as a yellow trace until a new reference contour is
 chosen or the measurement procedure is terminated.
 </p><p><u>Tip</u>: Probably the most useful
 reference contour is either the profile of the hard palate or of the upper
 incisors.
 </p><p><a name="5. Recording Further Sweeps"></a><b>5.
 Recording Further Sweeps</b>
 </p><p>Follow the instructions under (5)
 to record and store further sweeps for the investigation. You might want
 to make sure that the helmet position has not changed between sweeps. You
 can do so by asking the subject to press the tongue against the hard palate
 and check the displayed position of the sensors with respect to the contour
 of the hard palate (if you recorded this contour as your reference contour).
 If these two contours match quite well, that indicates the helmet is still
 correctly positioned.
 </p><p><a name="6. Turning off the Memory"></a><b>6.
 Turning off the Memory Function</b>
 </p><p><u>When you have completed your measurements,

 Taking off the Helmet and Removing the Sensors</b>
 </p><p>Loosen the helmet's fastening screws
 and take the helmet off by reversing the procedure for putting it on. Refer
 again to Fig. 3. The neck coil should remain in position and the chin coil
 should move through a semi-circle in front of the subject's face. Carefully
 remove the sensors from the subject's articulators with a pair of tweezers.

 </p><p><b>(1) Information Files</b>
 </p><p><b>T</b>hree information files are generated for each investigation
 carried out using the Articulograph AG100. If your investigation specifies
 the name "Test", the three files will be: <u>TEST.PRT</u>, <u>TEST.CFG</u>
 and <u>TEST.TIM</u>.
 </p><p><u>TEST.PRT</u> contains the protocol of the investigation "Test" and
 an be either printed out without further revision or can be edited using
 word processing software. The protocol file is the only information file
 that consists of normal text.
 </p><p><u>TEST.CFG</u> encodes the Articulograph AG100 operation parameters
 as well as the calibration data in force at the time of the investigation.
 </p><p><u>TEST.TIM</u> stores the starting time of each sweep of the investigation
 in binary form.
 </p><p><b>(2) Data Files</b>
 <br>For each investigation, 99 sets of movement data (sweeps) can be stored
 in data files with the same name. The running number of the sweep is encoded
 in the suffix of the file name. Three data files are produced for each
 sweep. Take "Test" as the specified name of the investigation, these files
 will be: <u>TEST.001...TEST.099</u>, <u>TEST.T01...TEST.T99</u>, <u>TEST.A01...TEST.A99</u>.
 </p><p><u>TEST.001...TEST.099</u> contain the movement data from the 1st to

 they were recorded.
 </p><p><u>TEST.T01...TEST.T99</u> contain a tilt factor for every coordinate
 pair that is saved in the corresponding files <u>TEST.001...TEST.099</u>.
 </p><p><u>TEST.A01...TEST.A99</u> contain the digital speech signal for each
 sweep.
 </p><p><a name="2. The EMALYSE Program for Data Analysis and"></a><b>2. The
 EMALYSE Program for Data Analysis and Evaluation</b>
 </p><p>You will use <u>the EMALYSE program</u> to analyze and evaluate the
 movement and acoustic data you acquired in the investigation. EMALYSE is
 a Windows program. In order to run this program, you need to open Windows
 and double click on the "emalyse" icon under "Microsoft Tools" (temporarily).
 The manual for the program is in the cupboard outside the "Postdoc Office".
 The manual itself is marginally comprehensible and you can probably walk
 your way through it. From my experience, there maybe some small bugs in
 the program, but they won't seriously affect your analysis. Here are some
 tips that might be helpful. <u>This is NOT intended
 as a substitute to the manual, so you should go read the manual first.
 If you have questions to which the manual doesn't have the answers, you
 might find the answers here.</u>
 </p><p>• When
 you use the "open data file" command in the "File" menu, a dialog box appears
 and it prompts you to open a *.TIM file. <u>When
 you load the *.TIM file, the program will automatically load all other
 necessary files according to the selected investigation. Then you should
 use the &lt;&lt;, -sweep- and &gt;&gt; buttons in the menu bar to open the desired
 sweep in your investigation.</u>
 </p><p>• The
 program can display various windows at the same time:
 </p><p>X/Y display of the sensors;
 </p><ul>
 <li>
 Acoustic signal window;</li>
 
 <li>
 Magnified acoustic window that shows
 the detailed sound signal around the current cursor position;</li>
 
 <li>
 DataView window that shows the numerical
 values of different parameters of the current cursor position;</li>
 </ul>
  Protocol window in
 which you can "note down" the numerical values of different parameters
 around the current cursor position and type in comments;
 <ul>
 <li>
 X position over time;</li>
 
 <li>
 Y position over time;</li>
 
 <li>
 X velocity over time;</li>
 
 <li>
 Y velocity over time;</li>
 
 <li>
 Tilt factor over time.</li>
 </ul>
 <u>You should arrange the windows in
 a way that best serves your purposes.</u>
 <br>
 <p>• <u>Your
 window's set-up can be saved as a *.dsk file in your own directory by using
 the "save set-up" function under the "File" menu. You can use the
 function "load set-up" under the "File" menu next time you open EMALYSE.
 You can also turn on the "save options on end" under the "Option" menu.
 Thus the path to the latest set-up will be written into the emalyse.ini
 file so that the latest set-up will be installed when you re-open the EMALYSE
 program.</u>
 </p><p>• When
 the main cursor is moved, it affects all windows synchronously. <u>The
 most efficient way of moving the cursor is to move it in the acoustic window.
 To move the cursor, hold down the left button of the mouse and the cursor
 will move with the mouse until the mouse button is released</u>.
 </p><p>• <u>You
 can use the "Note down" menu to record the numeric information of the data
 at the cursor time point to the "Protocol" window. You can use the
 "note down format" item under the "Options" menu to choose to write 1,
 3, or 5 lines to the protocol window. Each line consists of the x-position,
 the y-position and the tilt factor of 5 consecutive data samples and the
 first number of each line is the sample No. of the first of the five samples.
 If "1" is selected in the "note down format" of the "Option" menu, the
 "Note down" function takes down the sample data for the cursor position
 and also the data for the next four samples. If "3" is selected, the preceding
 five and the following five samples to these five samples will also be
 taken down in the protocol file. If "5" is selected, the preceding ten
 and the following ten samples to these five samples will also be taken
 down in the protocol file.</u>
 </p><p>• When
 you try to use the "Marker" menu to set markers or define segments, you
 might find the manual highly confusing. So here's the way to do these things:
 </p><p><u>If you want to set a marker:</u>
 <br>
 </p><blockquote>(a) Click on "Marker" in
 the menu bar.
 <br>(b) Click on the "new" button under
 "Marker".
 <br>(c) Type in a name for the marker
 under "Name".
 <br>(d) (Optional) Type in notes for
 the marker.
 <br>(e) Set the marker position using
 "set marker" or "...to cursor" under "Position".
 <br>(f) Click on the "OK" button.</blockquote>
 <u>If you want to define a segment:</u>
 <blockquote>(a) Click on "Marker" on
 the menu bar.
 <br>(b) Click on the "new" button under
 "Marker".
 <br>(c) Type in a name for the segment
 under "Name".
 <br>(d) (Optional) Type in notes for
 the segment.
 <br>(e) Click on "create" under "Segment".
 <br>(f) Click on "begin" under "Segment".
 <br>(g) Set the 1st marker position
 using "set marker" or "...to cursor" under "Position".
 <br>(h) Click on "end" under "Segment".
 <br>(i) Set the 2nd marker position
 using "set marker" or "...to cursor" under "Position".
 <br>(j) Click on the "OK" button.</blockquote>
 • You
 will probably find the following problem with regard to segments: when
 you choose "run current segment" under "Play mode" and click on "Play"
 in the menu bar, while the current segment IS being played, sometimes the
 cursor in the acoustic signal window does not move within the current segment.
 Try not to let it bother you. This might be a bug in the EMALYSE program.
 <p>• When
 you fiddle with the "X/Y-cursor" or "add reference contour" dialog box
 under the "Display" menu, the changes will only take effect AFTER you load
 another sweep of data.
 </p><p>• <u>Again,
 this section is NOT intended as a substitute for the manual of the EMALYSE
 program. You should go to the manual for detailed instructions of the program.</u>
 <br>
 <br>
 </p><p><a name="multicv"></a><b><u>3. Using MultiCV to Export
 Data in ASCII Format</u></b>
 </p><p>• If you plan to analyze EMA
 data with a program other than EMALYSE, you will need to save your data
 in ASCII format using MultiCV.
 </p><p>• To start MultiCV, double click on
 the <i>MultiCV.exe</i> icon on Igor's desktop.
 </p><p>• Click on the <i>"open file"</i>
 icon in the top left corner and select the file corresponding to the dataset
 that you want to export (the file you select must have the <i>.cfg</i>
 extension).
 </p><p>• Check the <i>trajectory-ASCII</i>
 option under <i>convert movement data</i> and click on the <i>"tools"</i>
 button to its right. Click on <i>point</i> under <i>decimal separator</i>.
 </p><p>• If you want to convert all the sweeps
 in the dataset, click on the <i>take all</i> button in the lower right
 section of the window. Otherwise, click on the sweeps you want to convert
 (one at a time) and then on the <i>&gt;&gt;</i> button.
 </p><p>• Click on the <i>exec. conversion</i>
 button. The conversion process takes some time.
 </p><p>• The converted sweeps are automatically
 stored in the directory of the original data, in a folder named <i>Convert</i>
 (in principle, it is possible to direct the converted data to other locations,
 but whenever we tried, MultiCV failed to work properly). Each converted
 sweep is saved as a text file named <i>namenumber.txt</i>, where <i>name</i>
 is the name of the dataset and <i>number</i> is the sweep number.
 </p><p>• Each line of a converted file (except
 the header line) corresponds to a sampling point, and it contains the following
 tab-delimited data fields: time, <i>x</i> dimension of channel 1, <i>y</i>
 dimension of channel 1, tilt factor of channel 1, <i>x</i> dimension of
 channel 2, <i>y</i> dimension of channel 2, tilt factor of channel 2...
 <i>x</i>
 dimension of channel 10, <i>y</i> dimension of channel 10, tilt factor
 of channel 10.
 </p><p>• Acoustic data can also be converted
 into ASCII files, but <u>trajectory and acoustic data cannot be converted
 at the same time</u>.
 </p><p>• To convert acoustic data, check
 the <u>sound-ASCII</u> option under
 <i>convert acoustic data</i> and proceed
 in the same way as with trajectory data.
 </p><p>• The converted acoustic data are
 automatically stored in a <i>Convert</i> folder in the same directory as
 the original data. The data from a sweep are saved in a text file named
 <i>namenumber.txt</i>,
 where <i>name</i> is the name of the dataset and
 <i>number</i> is the sweep
 number.
 </p><p>• <u>Important</u>: The converted
 acoustic files, like the converted articulatory files, are automatically
 saved in a <i>Convert</i> folder in the same directory as the original
 data. This means that, if you do not move or rename the
 <i>Convert</i>
 folder containing the articulatory data before converting the acoustic
 data, the <i>Convert</i> folder containing the acoustic data will replace
 the one containing the articulatory data, and the latter will be lost.
 </p><p>• Each line of a text file containing
 acoustic data corresponds to a sampling point, with two tab-delimited fields:
 time and sample.
 </p><p>• ASCII files containing EMA data
 can easily be converted into ESPS <i>fea_sd</i> files, which can be analyzed
 using XWAVES. To convert a file containing a single, header-less column
 of ASCII data corresponding to one channel into a <i>fea_sd</i> file, type
 the following command (of course, on a computer with the ESPS software
 installed): <i>testsd -r samplefq -a filename filename.sd</i> (where <i>samplefq</i>
 is the sampling frequency used to collect EMA data, <i>filename</i> is
 the name of the ASCII file and <i>filename.sd</i> is the name of the <i>fea_sd</i>
 file to be generated).
